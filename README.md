## üìô Documentation

LeakSignal installation and reference documents are available at leaksignal.com.

üëâ **[Quick Start](https://www.leaksignal.com/docs/#quickstarts)**

üëâ **[Installation](https://www.leaksignal.com/docs/#getting-started-with-a-demo-application)**

üëâ **[Sample Policies](https://github.com/leaksignal/leaksignal/tree/master/examples/policies)**

LeakSignal provides observability metrics and redaction capabilities for sensitive data contained within service mesh protocols. LeakSignal metrics can be consumed by Prometheus, pushed as OpenTelemetry, or collected in a centralized dashboard - giving MeshSecOps engineers (Incident Repsponse, SRE, DevOps, Platform Eng., SOC etc) a new security tool to help combat API exploits, unknown misconfigurations and sensitive data leakage.

## Features
* Fast, inline Layer 7 request/response analysis.
* Easy to configure rules ("L7 policy") for detecting and analyzing sensitive data (e.g. PII) leakage.
  * Detect PII, part numbers, account numbers, patient info, grades, dates, email addresses, large arrays, etc. You can write your own matcher or use our constantly evolving <a href="https://github.com/leaksignal/leaksignal/tree/master/examples/policies">ruleset</a> library (contributions welcome).
* Cloud dashboard with policy editor, monitoring, and alerting.
* Analysis metrics can be exposed via Envoy and thus reflected wherever Envoy metrics are configured to land (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, etc.)
